                Web Developer | Apple Genius | Musician
                <br />With a propensity to need to know how everything works and a drive to take everything to the next level, I've picked up a lot of professional skills and experience. Instead of believing a task is above me just because I haven't done it before, I simply teach myself how to do it and love every second of it.
